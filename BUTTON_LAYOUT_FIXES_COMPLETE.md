### Fixed Header Pattern

<div className="fixed top-4 left-0 right-0 z-50 flex justify-between items-center px-6">
  <div className="bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full shadow-lg">
    <LanguageToggle />
  </div>

  <button className="bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full p-3 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105">
    {/* Button content */}
  </button>
</div>;

{
  /* Main Content */
}
<div className="mt-20">{/* Content with proper margin-top */}</div>;
```

### Key Styling Classes Used

- `fixed top-4 left-0 right-0 z-50` - Fixed positioning
- `bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm` - Translucent background with blur
- `rounded-full shadow-lg` - Rounded buttons with shadows
- `hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105` - Hover effects
- `mt-20` - Content margin for fixed header
- `gap-4` - Consistent spacing between elements

## Responsive Design Improvements

- Added responsive text hiding with `hidden sm:inline`
- Implemented proper mobile layout considerations
- Enhanced hover and transition effects for better UX
- Improved button sizing and spacing for touch interfaces

## Z-Index Layering

- Header elements: `z-50`
- Content elements: `z-10` (where needed)
- Modal dialogs: `z-50`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cross-browser testing**: Verify layout works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on various screen sizes (320px to 1920px)
3. **Touch interaction**: Verify button tap targets are adequate (44px minimum)
4. **Accessibility**: Check keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
5. **Performance**: Verify backdrop-blur effects don't impact performance

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All identified button layout issues have been resolved across all components. The application now uses a consistent fixed header pattern that prevents overlapping and provides better organization of UI elements.

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly across different devices and browsers
2. Verify all interactive elements work correctly with the new layouts
3. Consider adding animation transitions for smoother UX
4. Monitor user feedback for any remaining layout issues
